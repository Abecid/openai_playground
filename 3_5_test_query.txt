I am creating a language model based on the open source model called "llama". There are prominent language models trained on llama called alpaca, vicuna, and orca. Other open source models have names like Falcon, MPT. Suggest a cool name for my language model that is easy to say and sounds cool such that it is easier to recruit potential employees to join my AI startup. But not too flashy so it sounds cheap. My language model is trained on many deep learning papers and can answer recent AI concepts up to papers from June 2023 in contrast to llama which can answer concepts up to 2021. Suggest 10! It should be easy to pronounce and remember
