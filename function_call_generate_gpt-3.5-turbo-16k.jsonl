OpenAI released new versions of GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 today. GPT-4 has a capability called function calling, which allows developers to describe programming functions to the AI models and have them create code to execute those functions. OpenAI also introduced a version of GPT-3.5-turbo with an expanded context window, offering four times the context length of the original version. Additionally, OpenAI reduced the pricing for GPT-3.5-turbo and text-embedding-ada-002 models.
