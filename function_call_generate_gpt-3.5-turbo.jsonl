OpenAI released new versions of GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 today. GPT-4 has the capability of function calling which allows developers to describe programming functions to the model and have it create code to execute those functions. They also introduced a different variant of GPT-3.5-turbo with an expanded context window. They have reduced pricing for GPT-3.5-turbo and text-embedding-ada-002 models. OpenAI has signaled that they will focus on incremental updates to existing models following the release of GPT-4.
